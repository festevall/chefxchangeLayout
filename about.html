                <h2>The History</h2>
                <p>Karl and Marc met each other in 2009 during their MBA at London Business School. Early 2013, we were at a dinner party hosted by Karl, enjoying some great food and good company. We had both started using Airbnb and were discussing how great it was to have a bit more income and get a chance to expand our social network by meeting great people. That is when it hit us that all over the world, people were getting to know each other over food more-so than in any other medium. We both are foodies and thought that the same marketplace model could be applied to cooking. We both love cooking and hosting and could think of nothing better than having a platform to help us get paid to do what we loved (as amateur Chefs); or hosting loved ones for a truly unique Culinary Experience. Thus began ChefXchange..</p>
